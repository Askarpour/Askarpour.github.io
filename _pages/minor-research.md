<h3>Quantum Computing</h3>
I had the opportunity to co-advice a group of motivated students for a course by [Prof. Di Nitto](https://dinitto.faculty.polimi.it/) at Politecnico di Milano. They started to figure out efficient implementations for existing quantum circuits using the IBM Qiskit library and perform state-of-the-art analysis of different subdomains of the quantum computing area.

Find two of our published works below:

* “Generalizing an Exactly-1 SAT Solver for Arbitrary Numbers of Variables, Clauses, and K” (2020). In: 1st Quantum Software Engineering and Technology Workshop (QSET). [More details](https://github.com/Megapiro/Quantum-Computing) and [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1xtlKiuA0k).

* "Experimental Implementation of Discrete Time Quantum Walk with the IBM Qiskit Library" (2021). In: Second International Workshop on Quantum Software Engineering (Q-SE). Co-located with ICSE 2021. [More details](https://github.com/Askarpour/sw2_quantum_research/tree/master/Olivieri) and [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHR96aF-HkM).
